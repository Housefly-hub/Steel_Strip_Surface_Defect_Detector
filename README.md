# Surface Defect Detection on Hot-Rolled Steel Strips

**Final Project for “AI for Manufacturing”** – Intel Digital Readiness Program & Gujarat Technological University (GTU)

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements an AI-based solution for detecting surface defects on hot-rolled steel strips. It was developed as part of the final project for the "AI for Manufacturing" course offered by Intel Digital Readiness Program in collaboration with GTU.

The goal is to automate visual inspection in steel manufacturing using image processing and machine learning to identify defects such as cracks, scratches, and other surface irregularities.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual inspection of steel surfaces is time-consuming and error-prone. This system aims to:

- Reduce human error in visual inspection
- Detect common surface defects efficiently
- Serve as a foundation for future deployment in industrial environments
